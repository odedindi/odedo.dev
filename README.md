This is my personal website, made with love using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [i18Next](https://www.i18next.com/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [GSAP(v3)](https://greensock.com/gsap/).
The project was bootstrapped using [`yarn create next-app --typescript`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).
