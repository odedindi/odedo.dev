Just wanted to play around with Three.js and we I like outer space, It's got this gallery showing the sun and all the planets, and a 3D model showing how the planets revolve around the sun with the ability to adjust the size of the sun and the planets to grasp the sheer size of the solar system, a glimpse into the dance of our cosmic neighbours. Just a little side projet."
